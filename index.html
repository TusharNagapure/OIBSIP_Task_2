                <li>He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced

                <li>In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)
                    which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980;
                    Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.</li>

                    at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,
                    and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.</li>
                <li>On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by
                    Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.</li>
